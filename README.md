# Pharmaceutical Inventory Management System

## Overview
The **Pharmaceutical Inventory Management System** is a Java-based application developed as an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** project. It simulates the core operations between a **wholesaler** and a **retailer** in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The system allows efficient inventory handling, transaction recording, and profit/loss computation across various types of medicines including **liquids**, **injections**, and **tablets**.

## Key Features

- **Inventory Management**: Monitor and update stock levels for different categories of medicines.
- **Sales Processing**: Simulate sales from wholesalers to retailers with accurate tracking.
- **Expense Tracking**: Record and calculate expenses incurred during procurement.
- **Income Calculation**: Compute income generated from wholesale distribution.
- **Final Reporting**: Generate summaries detailing income, expenses, and net profit.

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 22.0.1)
- Object-Oriented Programming Principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Data Abstraction)
- Collections Framework (e.g., ArrayList)
- File I/O for data persistence

## Project Structure

### Java Classes

- `WholesalerApp.java`: Main class to run the application and handle user interaction.
- `Medicine.java`: Abstract superclass representing generic medicine attributes and behaviors.
- `Liquid.java`: Inherits from `Medicine` — models liquid medicines.
- `Injection.java`: Inherits from `Medicine` — models injectable medicines.
- `Tablet.java`: Inherits from `Medicine` — models tablet-based medicines.

### Data Files

- `MedicineInventory.txt`: Initial inventory data file used by the wholesaler.
- `RandomMedicine.txt`: List of medicine requirements generated by the retailer.

## OOP Highlights

This project serves as a strong demonstration of OOP fundamentals:
- **Encapsulation**: Attributes are private and accessed via getters/setters.
- **Inheritance**: All medicine types extend from the base `Medicine` class.
- **Polymorphism**: Unified handling of different medicine types through abstract methods.
- **Modularity**: Clear separation of logic across classes for scalability and maintainability.

## Usage
Compile and run `WholesalerApp.java` to launch the system and interact via the console. Ensure text files are located in the project directory for data loading and output.
